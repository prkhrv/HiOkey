# HiOkey


## Inspiration

HiOKEY is a reliable source of medical information. Every minute around 70,000 patient searches for health-related issues on google. According to WHO(World Health Organization), about 20-30% of health information is misleading.

## What it does

HiOKEY provides the best way to deal with health queries. It works as a better version of the answers provided by search engines. It gives accurate health causes and the relevant prescriptions for the query directly from the physician's side.

## How we built it

We Build it Using Flutter and NodeJS with MYSQL as DataBase and Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications.

## Challenges we ran into

Make a very User-Friendly UI, which saves the time of physician while answering queries.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completing Two Applications in less than 36 hours.
